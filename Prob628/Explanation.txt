Approach 1 :- (Sorting) 

Time Complexity:-O(N*log(N)).
Space Complexity:-O(log(N)).--For Sorting.

In this approach we will initially sort the whole array and than check the max roduct that can be formed. Now the max product that can be formed can be 
there only from two places that is the combination of last three or combination of first two ana last one. Combination of last three is as these are the 
maximum number in the list and cobination of first two and last one as that what if product of two negative number will become more than product of two 
poisitive number so we have to check them like in example [-4,-3,-2,-1,60]. After getting max value from these we can retun that one as final answer.

Approach 2 :- (Math)

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(1).

On observing the above solution it is clear that there is no requirment of sort the whole array. At last we need only two minimum value and three maximum
values so we can get them easily just by itterating the array ones. And after doing this we can get our result as done before.
