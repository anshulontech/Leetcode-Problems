METHOD 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(1).
    
Approach:-
    We will traverse the array and on each encounter with a number we will make the corresponding number to it's negative . Now if After making it negative it remains poisitive than we cnclude that this index already occured in the array hence we ill add that to result.
