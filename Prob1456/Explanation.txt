Approach 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(1).

In this approach we are going to use the concept of sliding window in which we are maintaing a window of length k and also taking count of the 
number of vowels in this window. Now we are going to shift this window forward with maintaing it's length constant and if the next element inserted 
to the window is a vowel than we will increase the count of the number of vowels as this will get inserted in the new window and if the last element 
is also a vowel than as we will remove it from the window on moving forward, so we have to decrease the count of vowels as we will remove this 
element. On each shift of the window forward we will check the max value of the number of vowels and store the max in a result variable which we 
will return in last as the final answer.

In this approach we are using a map to check that is the current element is a vowel or not suh that the time time Complexity becomes O(1).

Approach 2:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(1).

In this we are using a vector to check that is the current element is a vowel or not. This is faster than the above approach as the map works using 
concept of linked list so it is not accurately O(1) but this approach is definately O(1), so it becomes little bit faster.
