Approach 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(1).

In this problem we are using an array of size 26 initialize with -1 and the index i represents that how many time we need to increase a character by 
i times. For example index 1 with value 3 represents that we need to increase 3 characters by 1 unit to make string s equal to t. Now as we will 
start to traverse the string we will first store the number of moves we need to change s[i] into t[i]. After getting the number of move we will 
first increase the count of the index difference and than check that is the max move formed cannot exceed given limit.For example for index i=1 with 
value 3 represents that we need moves 26*0+1,26*1+1,26*2+1 because we can use a move only ones so to use it again we need to add 26 to it. So to 
check this we will just check the last one that is this crosses the limit or not, If it is than we can't make s to i with given minimum move so we 
will return false in that condition else if we traverse the whole string without crossing the limit than we can return true.
