METHOD 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(N).
    
Approach:-
    In this we aill store the count of each num in nums1 in a map and than traverse the nums and if any num there having non zero 
    count in map than we will initially push it to the result vector and than we will decrease it's count by 1 and move forward.



METHOD 2:-

Time Complexity:-O(log(N)).
Space Complexity:-O(1).

Approach:-
    First we will sort the array and than use two pointer concept to store the numbers which occures in both the vectors.
