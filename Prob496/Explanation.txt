Symbols Used:-
N=nums2.size(),M=nums1.size();

Approach 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N*M).
Space Complexity:-O(1). Other Than result array.

In this approach what we will do is that we will traverse the whole array nums1 and for each number we will first find the poisition of that number 
in the nums2 array and after getting the poisition let say it i we will start to itterate the nums2 array from index i and check till last that is 
any number greater than the element at index i is there or not , if it is than we will push that element in the result array else we will return -1.

Approach 2:-

Time Complexity:-O(N+M).
Space Complexity:-O(N). Other Than result array.

In this approach we will use the concept of the strictly increasing monotone stack and a map to store the next greater element in the vector. So 
according to this concept what is happening is that if we have some elements in the stack and now we are on index i than we will pop out all the 
elements from the stack till the top of the element of the stack wil not become greater or equal to the nums2[i]. The elements which are popped out 
have the next greater element as nums2[i] hence we will push that one to the map. After doing this we will itterate the nums1 array and if the 
element is in the map than the answer is equal to value associated with that key in the map else the answer is -1.

Example for approach2:- (Just traversing nums2 as nums1 is easy to understand)

nums2={5,3,1,4,8};

let name of stack is s and map is map.

i=0;
s->empty,so push nums2[i] in the stack;
map->empty;

i=1;
s->{5};
as stack top is greater than nums2[i] so push this one in the stack.
map->empty;

i=2;
s->{5,3};
as stack top is greater than nums2[i] so push this one in the stack.
map->empty;

i=3;
s->{5,3,1};
As stack top is less than nums2[i] so pop it out and than push it to map representing that the next greater element of 1 is 4. so now the condition 
is as 
        s->{5,3};
        map->{{1,4}};

    Now as the stack top is again less than nums2[i] so the again pop it out and push it to map, so the conditions are as
        s->{5};
        map->{{1,4},{3,4}};
    Now the condition become false so break the loop and push the element 4 in the stack.

i=4;
s->{5,4};
As stack top is less than nums2[i] so pop it out and than push it to map.so now the condition is as 
        s->{5};
        map->{{1,4},{3,4},{4,8}};
    Now as the stack top is again less than nums2[i] so the again pop it out and push it to map, so the conditions are as
        s->empty;
        map->{{1,4},{3,4},{4,8},{5,8}};
    Now the condition become false as the stack becomes empty so break the loop and push the element 8 in the stack.


Now as the itterator reaches the end of the vector so we will now traverse the nums1 array and do the procedure(as discussed above) to obtain result.
