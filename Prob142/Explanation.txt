METHOD 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N)
Space Complexity:-O(1)

Approach:-
    Using two pointers system first we start that find that is their any cycle is present or not.The way by which two pointer syste works is as that we have two pointers named slow and fast we run the loop till fast->next!=NULL&&fast->next->next!=NULL.In the loop a condition is also checked that if slow==fast ,if the conditionis true it represent that the cycle is present or till last if condition was not satisfied it represents theiris no cycle present and hence return NULL. If cycle is present than the key concept is that the distance between the node which slow represents and the beginning of the cycle is equal to the distanceof the beginning of the cycle and the head node. So to find the start of the cycle we run loop inside the while condition and upon termination of the loop we return entry which represents beginningof the cycle.
