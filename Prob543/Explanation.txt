METHOD 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(1).
    
Approach:-
    To find the diametre of the tree with respect to node we requires two things i.e; max height of it's left subtree and it's 
    right subtree and the diameter of the tree with respect to that node is sub of both heights +1. So Using this approach we are 
    going to solve the problem and calculate the max height for both sides of each node and than compare this with the previous 
    diameter. If it will be greater than the previous one than than we will update it's value and in last return that one.
