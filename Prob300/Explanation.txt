METHOD 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N^2).
Space Complexity:-O(N).
    
Approach:-
    In this whart we are going to use is the concept of dynamic programming. Here we are initially we are taking an array of size 
    N and store value 1 to all the blocks. Now we are going to traverse the arrayy using two for loops that is we are traversing 
    it twice hence the time complexity would result into N^2. Now let us suppose we are at any index j in array so now we are 
    going to traverse the array from 0 index till j1 index. At each step we are checking that is the value of the jth index will 
    be greater than the ith index or not. If it will than it means that the subsequence till ith index can be expanded by using 
    jth index so we will check that if the increasing the subsequence f ith index with j result in longer one than the previous of 
    j or not. If it will than we will assign in array the ith value +1 . As the array represents the max length of subsequence 
    till that index. After traversing this way we will check that what is the max value and will return that one.
