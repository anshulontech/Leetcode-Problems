METHOD 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N) Where N is nth poisition of last 1 bit.
Space Complexity:-O(1).
    
Approach:-
    In this we are going to calculate the last bit and checking that is this 1 or not. If it will than we increase the count else 
    just leave the number.

METHOD 2:-

Time Complexity:-O(N) Where N is number of 1 bits.
Space Complexity:-O(1).

Approach:-
    Same Approach but faster approach.
