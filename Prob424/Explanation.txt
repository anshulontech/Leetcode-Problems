METHOD 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(1).
    
Approach:-
    We are going to use a window here , and taking the help of a vector which is used to store the count of each char in the 
    window. Now at the end of the window we will note that is the number of characters different from s[end] have count greater 
    than k r not . If they were than we decreament their count by reducing our window . We wil mke it till their count does not 
    become less than k. After this we check the condition for max_length and than increament the window size by 1 and so on.
