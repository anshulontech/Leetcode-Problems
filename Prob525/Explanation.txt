METHOD 1:-

Time Complexity:=O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(N).
    
Approach:-
    Initially we will make an unordered map and store (0,-1) to it. The key represents sum in the map and value represents the index of that sum in array. As we are traversing the array we update the sum and index to the map. Sum is updated by the scheme that for zer it will decrease by 1 and for 1 it will increase. As the sum is zero represents the total nubet of zeroes and 1 are equal in the same way equal amount of su represents equal number of 1 and 0 in the subarray.So using this scheme we are updating the max_length variable by checkig that is the new difference between index is greater than previous length or not.
