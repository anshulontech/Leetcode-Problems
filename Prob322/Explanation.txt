METHOD 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N*amount).
Space Complexity:-O(amount).
    
Approach:-
    In this what we are doing is that we will us top - bottom approach in which we will check for 
    each amount which is less than given amount. And store their result in an array and for the 
    further amount we dont need to look backward but will just get their values from that vector.
