METHOD 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(log(n)).
Space Complexity:-O(1).
    
Approach :-
    In this we are going to calculate the total number of factors as 5 in n! using the thing that to calculate no of factors 
    divide the nubmber with 5 and add quotient to res and do the same thing for the new number obtained . So what happened by 
    doing this way is that first you calculate total number of number having factore 5 than calculate nubers havng factor 5*5 and 
    so on.
