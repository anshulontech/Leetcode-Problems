METHOD 1:-

Time Coplexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(N).
    
Approach:-
    Using recurssion we are going to see preorder traversal.

METHOD 2:-

Time Coplexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(N).

Approach:-
    Using iteration we are going to see preorder traversal.

METHOD 3:-

Time Coplexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(1).

Approach:-
    Using Moris traversal we are going to see preorder traversal.
