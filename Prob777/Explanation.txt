Approach 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(1).

In this what we are doing is that we are ignoring the 'X' characters in both of the strings and than try to compare the poisition of other elements.
Now lwt the i pointer represents the start string and the ned pointer represents he end string than we will increment both the pointers untill we 
not get non-'X' character . Now if both the elements are 'L' and the start's pointer is greater than end's pointer than we can change them because 
the character 'L' can move only to the left hence to do so the start pointer should be greater than or equal to end pointer than we can do if 
further elements full fill the condition. Otherwise if both the characters are 'R' than start pointer should be less than or equal to end pointer 
because 'R' can move only to the right. And if both the characters are different than in that condition we can't do so because the characters 'L' 
and 'R' are not inter-changeable. If both the pointers reaches the end of the list at the same time than it represents that they can be interchanged 
hence we can return true in that condition.
