METHOD 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(1).
    
Approach:-
    In this first we will reverse whole array and than reverse first k characters and than reverse next k characters to get our 
    final result. As we reverse the whole array and than reverse the furst k elements in the array than what happened is that the 
    n-k th element reaches the 0th index and so on we can generate the whole array.
