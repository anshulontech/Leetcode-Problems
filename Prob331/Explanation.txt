Approach 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(N).  For recurssion stack.

In this appproach what we are going to do is that we are going to itterate the tree as preorder traversal without building the tree again. So as 
same as preorder traversal we will first traverse the left subtree and than right subtree. On encounter with the null node that is "#" in this case 
we will return from there. Now as we are traversing if the whole tree is traversed completely that is both left and right subtree are traversed for 
each node and all the nodes in the list are traversed than in that situation we can say that this is the verified Preorder Serialization of a Binary 
Tree. But if some nodes left and right subtree are not traversed just because the nodes in the list got finished or after travesing the whole tree 
some nodes remains in the list which are not part of the tree than in that situation we can say that it is not Preorder Serialization of a Binary 
Tree and hence we can return false.
