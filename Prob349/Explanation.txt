METHOD 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(N).
    
Approach:-
    Initially we will store the elements of nums1 in a set and than go for the nums2 and if found any integer in nums2 that is in
    set than we will first remove that element from the set and than add that one to the result vector and finally return the 
    result vector.

METHOD 2:-

Time Complexity:-O(log(N)).
Space Complexity:-O(1).

Approach:-
    First we will sort the array and than use two pointer concept to store the numbers which occures in both the vectors.
