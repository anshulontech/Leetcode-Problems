Approach 1:-(DFS).

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(N).

In this approach what we are going to do is that we will store the nodes with their coordinates in a nested map suing recurssion. The outer map's 
key represents the x coordinate of the node while the inner map's key represents the y coordinate of the nodes. After traversing the whole tree we 
will use the map to store the result. Nodes with lesser x and y coordinate comes first in the array and those with higher coordinates will occurs in 
the last. 

How does Coordinate Change:-

On Moving left we wll decrease the x cooridinate while on moving down we will increase the y coordinate so what is happening here is that the outer 
map's first element contains the left most nodes set and the first element of each outer map store the top most element in that row, so by 
traversing in order we can generate the result. This is because we are using ordered_map which stores the elements in ascending order.

Approach 2:-(BFS)

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:O(N).

Approah is same as that above one but the difference is that their we are using recurssion but here we are using itteration.
