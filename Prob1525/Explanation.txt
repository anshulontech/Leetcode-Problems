Approach 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(N).

Initially we will assume that string p contains 1 character and q contains rest of all. So we will store the count of each character of q in a map and 
their occurence in a set while we will store the occurence of each character in p n another set. Now we will start to increase our itteratot representing
that p start to extend while q start to contract. As p expands we will add the new elements of p in it's set while decrease the count of character in q , 
at any instance when count of any character in q becomes zero representing that this character is not in set we will remove this from the set . The set 
basically represents that the number of unique characters in the string so after each step we will check that is the size of sets arae same or not, if the 
size of the sets are same than it represents that both contains equal number of unique characters and after itterarting the whole string we will return the 
obtained result.
