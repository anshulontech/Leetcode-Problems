METHOD 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N^2).
Space Compleixty:-O(N^2). For recurssion stack.
    
    Approach:- (This Approach gives time limit exceed for only 1 case that is on leetcode it passes 123/124 test cases). In this 
what we are going to do is that we will check that is there more profit in including this house or not, so for this we will 
run two loops first to include the current node and the other to exclude it and than we will return the maximum of them . By 
doing the current node we will check it for the eft and right subtrees and so on.


METHOD 2:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Compleixty:-O(N).

Approach:-
    In this approach we are doing the same thing but here what we are going to do is that for each node we will store the max 
result for it subtree in a map so that if we want the value for this subtree than we have no need to traverse it again.
