Approach 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(1).

On Observing the above it is found that we can check all the words with respect to the 2nd letter in the string. 

For example if the second letter is a Capital letter than it is necessary that first letter should be capital if it is not than we can easily return 
false otherwise return true.

Now for the letters from index 2 or from 2rd letter onwards all letter's type that is isCapital should match with the 2nd letter's type that is if 
2nd letter is Capital than all letters fter this should be capital or vice versa , if it is true that is all letter's type comes out to be same as 
that of second letter than we can return true else will return false.
