METHOD 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(1).

Approach:-
    By observation it was clear that the number to which an alphaebat represents depands upon the poisition from last and what 
    value it contains. Like decimal form this problem can be solved. Let us assume that we are given a string of characters having 
    values between 0 and 9 and we have to change it into integer form. So to solve this what we are doing is to first multiply 
    last digit by 10^0 and previous by 10^1 than it's previous by 10^2 and so on. Similarely In this problem we are changing the 
    string into alphabatical form which has a base of 26. So in this what we are going to do is that multiply last one by 26^0 
    than preious one by 26^1 than it's previous one by 26^2 and so on and hence on last the result obtain will be final answer.
