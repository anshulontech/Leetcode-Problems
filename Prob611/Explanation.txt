METHOD 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N^2).
Space Comlexity:-O(log(n)).
    
Approach:-
    In this what we are going to do is that we will initially sort the given array and for each pair of nums[i], nums[j] we will 
    found the right most index k such that nums[i] + nums[j] > nums[k] because if this holds true and we whave sorted array so nums
    [k] is always greater than nums[i] and nums[j] so adding anything to nums[k] would not affect the result. Now here we ware 
    going to optimise the solution by not usinf another loop for finding the k here we are just finding k on the basis of the 
    previous reult because for every increasig pair k will be after to that one which was found earlier so what we will try is to 
    found it from the previous reult ue to which the time complexity changes to O(N^2) from O(N^3).
