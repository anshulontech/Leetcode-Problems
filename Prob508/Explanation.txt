METHOD 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Compleixty:-O(N).
    
Approach:-  (One Pass Hash Map)
    Initially we will use ModifyTree function to modify the tree such that the value of root node is the sum of it's subtree and also store the sum into a hash map. Now we will iterate the hash map and the sum's having max frequency are taken into a vector as final answer.

METHOD 3:-

Approach:-
    Similar that of above one but here to calculate the max_freq we are doing operations only when we are modifying the tree so that we have no more requirment of one more pass to the hash map.
