METHOD 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(N).

Approach:- (Iterative)
    We are just following the approach of level order traversal of bnary tree but here the difference is that in case of binary 
    tree we are checking for left and right child but here we are checking for all the children elements.
