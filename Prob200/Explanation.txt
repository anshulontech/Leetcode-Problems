METHOD 1:-

Time coplexity:-O(N^2).
Space Complexity:-O(1).
    
Approach:-
    Initially we will make a variable named count whiah is used to store the number of island in the grid. On itterating the grid 
    if we will get encountred with '1' than it represents a island hence we will increase the value of count by 1 and call a 
    function named remove_island which is used to ake that 1 to 0 and all nearby 1 also as they all are also the part of the that 
    island. In thi loop again using backtrackig we will remove all other neraby 1 to 0 and hence by this all are converted into a 
    part of water and will not be counted any more. I the last we will return the value of count which denotes the number of 
    island in the grid.
