METHOD 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N^2).
Space Complexity:-O(N^2).
    
Approach:-
    In this what we are going to do is the use of divide and conqure approach. So initially we will count the occurence of 
    each character in a map . Now we will start to traverse the string till the character whose count is not less than k. 
    At this stage we will divide the substring into two parts left and right and than check individually for these strings 
    using recurssion and than return the max result that would come from these two.
