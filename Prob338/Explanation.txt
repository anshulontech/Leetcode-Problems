METHOD 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(N)   -- Used for the answer to stroe values.
    
Approach:-
    On observing the pattern we can found that the number of 1 bits in a number is equal to 1+ number of 1 bits in number which is 
less than offset. So in this we are doing the same.
    
What is offset?
    Here offset represents the last number which has only 2 as prime factor. So on observation we can folow the explanation as 
    explained above.
    
Example for observation:- Let initially offset =1;

0->0;
1->1;        1 - 1 = 0 so number of bits is 0 + 1;
2->0 1;      now offset changes as 2 has only 2 as prime factor 2 - 1 = 1 so number of bits is 0 + 1; offset = 2;
3->1 1;      3 - 2 = 1 so number of bits is 1 + 1;
4->0 0 1;    4 - 4 = 0 so number of bits is 0 + 1; offset changed = 4;
5->1 0 1;    5 - 4 = 1 so number of bits is 1 + 1;
6->0 1 1;    6 - 4 = 2 so number of bits is 1 + 1;
7->1 1 1;    7 - 4 = 3 so number of bits is 2 + 1;
8->0 0 1;    8 - 8 = 0 so number of bits is 0 + 1 as offset changed to 8;
