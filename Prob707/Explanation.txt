Approach 1:-

In this approach we are building our own linked list node with name myNode which has two variables in it. The first one is an integer type which is 
used to store the value of the node while the other one is pointer to myNode used to store the address of the next node in the list.

get(int index) Function:-
    Time Complexity:-O(index).
    Space Complexity:-O(1).

In this function we will check that if the index is valid than we will move to that index in the list in O(index) time and return the value of that 
node. If the index is not valid than we will return -1.

addAtHead(int val) Function:-

    Time Complexity:-O(1).
    Space Complexity:-O(1).

Making a new node with value equal to val and than the next pointer of the new node now points to te head of the list and the root node that is 
global head of the list now points to the new node.

addAtTail(int val) Function:-

    Time Complexity:-O(N).
    Space Complexity:-O(1).

By traversing we will reach the end node of the list and than insert a new node at the end with value equal to val.

addAtIndex(int index ,int val) Function:-

    Time Complexity:-O(index).
    Space Complexity:-O(1).

By traversing we will reach the index -1 node of the list and than making a new node their and the next pointer of index-1 node points to the new 
node and the next pointer of the new node points to the previous index node and hence by doing this we can insert a node at given index.

deleteAtIndex(int index)

    Time Complexity:-O(index).
    Space Complexity:-O(1).

By traversing the list we will reach the index -1 node of the list and than the next pointer of the index -1 node points to next pointer of index 
node, so by doing this now the next pointer of index -1 node points to index +1 node and hence the index node is skipped and hence we can say that 
this node is deleted from the list.
